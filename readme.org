* Giftopotamus
Giftopotamus is a web app for creating gift exchanges.

You can add participants directly from the website, or import a CSV:
| name | email           | restrictions | previous | participating | has |
|------+-----------------+--------------+----------+---------------+-----|
| foo  | foo@example.com | quux         | bar, baz | yes           |     |

The [[file:giftex][giftex]] package provides an implementation of the Kuhn-Munkres
assignment algorithm for creating gift exchanges.

Kuhn-Munkres, or the "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm][Hungarian Algorithm]]" allows us to easily
determine whether an assignment exists that can satisfy all
constraints of the given gift exchange.

Once the set of constraints are verified, a final assignment is made
at random because a completely deterministic gift exchange would spoil
the fun.
